# Predicting Real Estate Market Demand in Illinois
This repository contains files related to an analysis of Illinois inventory data from 2013 to 2019. I am a real estate investor in Illinois. I have always wanted to know - "what are the top neighborhoods in Illinois that are in high demand?" Also, I have wanted a tool that I can consistently leverage to identify markets in high demand for investing purposes. To answer this, I used logstic regression to predict demand (days on market) for every market (zip code) in Illinois.

US Inventory data can be found [here](https://www.realtor.com/research/data/) from Realtor.com. To read more about the project, including how the model performed, visit my [blog](https://radaley1906.wixsite.com/raddatascience/post/predicting-real-estate-market-demand).
